    # Synopsis

    Automatically registers IP addresses of EC2 instances to a Route 53 hosted zone. The function is invoked via EventBridge and registers resource record sets according to tags of instances.

    ## Tags

    Tags to be considered are:

    | Tag        | Description                                                                                                                      |
    | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | HostedZone | The ID of the Route 53 hosted zone to which resource records will be created.  Only the instances having this tag are processed. |
    | Name       | The host name to be used for CNAME records.  IDN is supported.                                                                   |
    | HostName   | Same as \`Name\` but takes precedence.                                                                                             |

    \`A\` and/or \`AAAA\` records will be created for each instances and \`CNAME\` record will be created if either \`Name\` or \`HostName\` tag is defined.  Public addresses are used for public hosted zones and private addresses for private hosted zones.
